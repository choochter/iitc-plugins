Plugins for IITC

* iitc-plugin-highlight-ap   - Plugin that adds a portal highlighter that shows the AP available at that portal; as the AP from the portal increases, the highlighter changes from Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Black
* iitc-plugin-os-map-link    - Adds a new Map Link that opens the selected portal's location in the UK's Ordanance Survey map; as this only covers the UK, portals outside this area will see unpredictable behaviour :-)
* iitc-plugin-weapon-effect  - Adds a burst template at the mouse location simulating either an XMP Level 8 or Ultrastrike Level 8
* iitc-plugin-opsig-map-link - Adds a new Map Link that opens the selected portal's location in the Open Signal map; as this only covers the UK, portals outside this area will see unpredictable behaviour :-)
